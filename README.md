# AnimeyBalls
This is a random design code with random coloured balls.<br>
They are bouncing off your screen and making sounds like never before.<br>
![alt tag](https://github.com/Shubhamsingh147/AnimeyBalls/blob/master/image.png)
They ask for your permission to release your mic on<br>
They recognize your sound level and just increase their speed accordingly :D <br>
Enjoy the fun!!!
